<div>                            The  NCU (National Central University) has experience in the preparation of proton  conducting solid oxide fuel cells consisting of a proton  conductor via tape casting, co-sintering and sample characterization by means  of TGA, DSC, Raman, FIB, HRTEM, GC-Mass, CV, and EIS techniques. An exchange of  partners and experiences will produce deeper cooperation, more complementary  sample characterization and more effective fuel cell construction. The  cooperation between WUT and NCU groups will be very intense during the proposed  project. This project will be the first stage of a&nbsp;fruitful and permanent  cooperation.                    </div>
